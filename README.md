# 👋 Hi, I'm Carlos Bravo

I’m an **18-year-old Software Engineering student** currently studying at **UPAEP**, with an expected graduation year of **2029**. I’m originally from **Orizaba, Mexico**, and I currently live in **Puebla** while studying independently.

I’m a **beginner developer** focused on building strong foundations, especially in **Python**, with a clear interest in **backend development**, **system design**, and long-term growth as a software engineer. I enjoy learning by building real projects and understanding how systems work under the hood.
