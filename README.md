# Inventory & Sales Management System (CLI)

A **console-based inventory and sales management system** written in **Python**, developed as a university project.

This project simulates a simplified **ERP-like workflow**, covering product purchasing, storage management, and sales transactions, with a strong focus on **business logic** and **data structures**.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Load **providers** and **products** from external `.txt` files
* Purchase products as a customer, respecting stock limits and storage capacity
* Internal warehouse management (add, edit, and delete stored products)
* Sell products as a vendor
* Track and display **sales history**
* Input validation and realistic business rules
* ANSI color output for better CLI user experience

---

## 🧠 Project Focus

* Business logic implementation
* Structured data handling using **lists** and **dictionaries**
* Procedural programming (no OOP yet)
* End-to-end flow simulation (purchase → storage → sale)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* Command Line Interface (CLI)
* Text files for data input

---

## 📂 Data Handling
